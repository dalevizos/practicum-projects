    "# Analyzing mosquito species Aedes aegypti transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is to analyze how much transmission has occurred in a small town (date: January 1, 2020) and the current state of exposed individuals from the mosquito species Aedes aegypti. For each community member tested, we have the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- birthdate: patient's date of birth\n",
    "- exposed_date: date the patient first noticed mosquito bites\n",
    "- test_results: 'Pos' = positive, 'Neg' = negative, or 'TBD' = to be determined\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, we will classify each patient into one of the transmission categories below and compare the size of each category across age groups. The transmission categories will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Susceptible': does not have the virus but is able to get it\n",
    "- 'Exposed': has been bitten by infectious mosquitoes and might have the virus\n",
    "- 'Infectious': has the virus and is currently able to transmit to new mosquitoes\n",
    "- 'Recovered': had the virus and is no longer infectious or susceptible\n",
    "- 'Unknown': not enough information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of the steps we will take:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we will use each patient's birthdate to calculate their age and place them into age groups.\n",
    "- Secondly, we'll use exposed_date and test_results to place patients into one of the five transmission categories.\n",
    "- Finally, we will examine counts within each transmission category by age group using a pivot table."
